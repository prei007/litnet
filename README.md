# LitGraph - supporting the 'living review' 

A literature review method that uses RDF, SKOS, AllegroGraph, R and RShiny. 
It supports the coding step in a literature review: identifying the properties of and the 
relations between studies (papers). For this,  there is a Shiny application with a point and click interface
to the database with the study descriptions and codes. 

## Functional description
The main use case is the preparation of an analytical literature review or research synthesis (used synonymously). The assumption is that the review takes the form of the reviewer attaching codes to publications (or parts of publications, i.e., micropublications) and creates relations between (parts of) publications. An example for a code is the age group of the human participants in a learning research study; an example for a relation between two studies is that P1 cites P2.
