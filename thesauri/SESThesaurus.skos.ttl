	skos:prefLabel "Individual sensing"@en ;
	skos:scopeNote "What endogenous and exogenous state variables are individuals assumed to sense and consider in their decisions? Is the sensing process erroneous? What state variables of which other individuals can an individual perceive? Is the sensing process erroneous? What is the spatial scale of sensing? Are the mechanisms by which agents obtain information modelled explicitly, or are individuals simply assumed to know these variables?" ;

What is the basic rationality behind agent decision-making in the model? Do agents pursue an explicit objective or have other success criteria?
How do agents make their decisions? Do the agents adapt their behaviour to changing endogenous and exogenous state variables? And if yes, how? Do social norms or cultural values play a role in the decision-making process? Do spatial aspects play a role in the decision process? Do temporal aspects play a role in the decision process? To which extent and how is uncertainty included in the agents’ decision rules?" ;
