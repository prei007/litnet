		anno:body "A very interesting paper. Combines VR (of a river ecosystem) with a simple variant of NetLogo plus various non-computational representations: Causal maps and variables over time diagrams. Builds on the notion of transformative modeling, which refers to a notion from Latour of scientists inscribing models in multiple notations and overlaying them, comparing and constrasting them. I think the VR might be easily replaced with video or stop-image animation as it mainly is about going back and forth in time in the ecoystem, thus showing chanbges over years in minutes or a time travel format. I think the re-presentation/transformative modeling is important. see also HmeloSilver2014, HmeloSilver2015"] .
