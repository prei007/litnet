These are dynamic simulation of agents (species), graphs of the total population over time, textual resources, and causal maps. See HmeloSilver. There's a lot of attention spent on a fading strategy.

I think the VR might be easily replaced with video or stop-image animation as it mainly is about going back and forth in time in the ecoystem, thus showing chanbges over years in minutes or a time travel format.
