# Semantic Literature Review

A literature review method that uses RDF, SKOS, AllegroGraph, R and RShiny. 
It supports the coding step in a literature review: identifying the properties and the 
relations of studies (papers) and supports the construction of the tables typical for 
systematic lit reviews. It also includes a Shiny application with a point and click interface
to the database.
