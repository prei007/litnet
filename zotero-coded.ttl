Builds on the competence model by Mehren et al. 2018.  The review of computer games is oriented on a framework for complexity. Driving questions (p. 2): >The main questions we strive to answer are: Do digital games provide the requirements necessary for the development of geographical systems thinking and competence? How complex are their modelled systems, and how do the games diﬀer with respect to their complex game design? Are there groups of games that are more suitable for acquiring geographical system competence than others?< In Figure 1 on Page 6 the authors depict their complexity framework but I find it too syntactic. It's basically asking how many elements and relations. It's useful, but not comprehensive enough. Compared to, say ODD and ODD+, it's simplistic. But then, this is about games, not simulations. From my perspective missing is an opening of the black box that hides human cognition and decision making. It is probably fair to say that these strategy games take the human side much more into account than most educational EE simulations, but they do not simulate actual human decision making. And your typical off-the-shelve game is opaque. The game overview is very helpful though!  As so often, the idea that computer should be mind tools, not only learning tools, is forgotten. "] .

		anno:body " Mainly about model-based reasoning and learning. Definitely interesting, but No human decision making modelled. Grounded cognition as theoretical backdrop. The coding system (Table 2) is interesting because it contains descriptors for gaining knowledge from the model simulation.  See also Table 9 for common sources of mistakes. Interesting! A second coding dimensin (TAble 6) is for the relations participants see between the model and real systems. The notion of observed grounding in an activity system much larger than the simulation resonates with my sense of augmentation, and the linking between real--or modelled real--systems and the computer model. So here we can say: students will add their own interpretations and associations, and it may be better to allow them to make explicit. A quantitative analysis is provided in Kelly et al 2012, ICLS conference."] .
